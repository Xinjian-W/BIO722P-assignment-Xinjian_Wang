    "* Notebook is written in Python 3 and can be opened and run on the QMUL JupyterHub.\n",
    "* Any import statements are grouped in the cell provided at the end of this introduction; there should be no other import statements in the notebook.\n",
    "* Notebook functions pass all tests when cells are run with a fresh kernel from top to bottom.\n",
    "* Notebook only contains well commented answer code and the original tests. Please remove your own test code.\n",
    "* Notebook includes the full name and student number of the author.\n",
    "* Zip file containing the notebook is free from errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please refrain from editing the text of the assignment and the test code provided. Feel free to insert text or code cells as needed, but please clean up rough work that you do not wish to be marked.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Marking\n",
    "\n",
    "Your work will be marked **automatically**. Marks will be based on:\n",
    "\n",
    "        completeness and correctness: 100%\n",
    "        \n",
    "For automatic marking to function appropriately, each of your answers **must** pass the tests provided when running the notebook from top to bottom on a fresh kernel. Code that does not pass the tests or is not run (directly or indirectly, e.g. a function calling another function) by the functions you are asked to implement will **not** be marked.\n",
    "\n",
    "The test code provided with each question does **not** ensure that your submission is correct; it only ensures that it can be marked automatically. You will need to test your code independently for correctness; however, please remove your test code from your final submission, and do not submit any test data; the marking script will test your code with its own choice of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to answer questions\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment contains four questions, that can in principle be tackled in any order. However, we suggest that you answer Question 3 before attempting Question 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each question will require you to code a few functions or other code. As you progress through the subquestions, you may have to rely on your answer to previous subquestions to perform some operations. Please call the relevant functions and avoid duplicating code.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Do not remove or edit the comments at the top of the answer cells - marking scripts depend on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use of libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "The assignment can be solved using built in functions and types, and we recommend that you do not use anything else. However, you are free to import any module or package from the Python standard library only. Third party or non-standard libraries (including Biopython) are **not** allowed."

    "### Question 4.c: Computing a distance matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function called ```distanceMatrix``` that takes as its argument two strings called ```inputfile``` and ```outputfile```, used to pass the names of the input and output file. The function should use ```readTable``` to read from the input file CSV data created as specified at the end of Question 3 (again, you do not necessarily have to answer Question 3 in order to do this; you can create a CSV file with made-up data using an editor). Suppose data for N proteins are read. Your function should then create an output TSV file containing a matrix of size NxN (plus one row and one column for labels). The rows and columns of the matrix should correspond to individual protein file names, so that each matrix entry corresponds to a pair of proteins, say Pxxx and Pyyy. Such entry should contain the Manhattan distance between the ```(polar, small, hydrophobic)``` tuples (considered as 3 dimensional vectors) corresponding to Pxxx and Pyyy. If done correctly, your matrix should be symmetric and have zeroes on the diagonal. Format the matrix with row and column labels as in the following 3-protein example (that contains random numbers and filenames):\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Filename      Pxxx.fas  Pyyy.fas  Pzzz.fas\n",
    "Pxxx.fas        0.00      2.34      1.51\n",
    "Pyyy.fas        2.34      0.00      1.82 \n",
    "Pzzz.fas        1.51      1.82      0.00\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "The exact alignment is not important, as long as the data are separated by tabs and the first line starts with a hash (```#```). Likewise, the order in which the proteins are listed is not important, provided the same order is used along the rows and along the columns. Do not add any quotes or other spurious characters. Your function should not return any value."
